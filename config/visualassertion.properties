# box: Draw a box with blocksize, the difference box might not be in the center, it is effectivly

# marker: Use yellow highlighter and mark different pixels in red too

# The algorithm used for the determination of layout differences.
# 
# FUZZY: Uses color and pixel difference thresholds that determine when the difference in 
#        a block of pixels is a error. First the difference in color between each pixel in a block
#        is checked, if the number of pixels, for which the color difference is too high,
#        exceeds the number limit in one block, those differences are seen as error and marked. 
# 
# COLORFUZZY: Only uses a color threshold to determine a layout error. One detected difference will 
#             fail the test. Based on a comparison algorithm from http://www.compuphase.com/cmetric.htm . 
#             The algorithm is based on experiments with people, not theoretics.
# EXACT: Does not use any thresholds, checks for exact pixel by pixel match
com.xceptance.xlt.visualassertion.algorithm=FUZZY

# Color threshold for COLORFUZZY and FUZZY. Takes a value between 0 and 1 that stands for the 
# color difference in percent between two pixels. 0 is equal to an exact pixel by pixel comparison, where
# no difference is allowed.

# Number of pixel differences threshold for FUZZY in one comparison block. Takes a value between 0 and 1 that 
# stands for the percentage of different pixels in one block. 0 is equal to an exact pixel by pixel comparison.
# 0.1 would mean that 10% of pixels can be different. 
com.xceptance.xlt.visualassertion.tolerance.pixels=0.1

# The side length of one comparison block for the FUZZY algorithm. Takes integer values that stand for the number of 
# pixels per side. The values provide a way to tolerate shifts of small objects, especially text. The values divide the image
